# nyanobot
A simple public Discord bot to be notified when a new Nyano Cat (Nano 'NFT') is traded on Nanswap!

You can also use it in your own server and keep track of all Nyano trades by inviting it at this link here:

Simply use `!setchannel <channelid>` and `!setrole <roleid>` respectively and you're good to go!
