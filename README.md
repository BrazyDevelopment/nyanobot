# nyanobot
A simple public Discord bot to be notified when a new Nyano Cat (Nano 'NFT') is traded on Nanswap!

You can also use it in your own server and keep track of all Nyano trades by inviting it at this link here:
https://nyanobot.armour.dev/invite

Simply use `!setchannel <channelid>` and `!setrole <roleid>` respectively and you're good to go! 

If you're downloading and using the open source version, then you need to configure the `config.template.json` and rename is to `config.json` for production.
